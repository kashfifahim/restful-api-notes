node.js is a popular back-end javascript runtime used to create web applications 

front-end consists of the information sent to a client so that a user can see and interact with a website 
a web server is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses
every website has at least one web server 

the specific format of a request and the resulting response is called the protocol 

application server is the collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, process payments, and myriad other tasks
the back-ends of modern web applications include some sort of database 
databases are collections of information 

databases can be divided into two types: relational databases and non-relational databases(NoSQL)
relational databases store information in tables with columns and rows 
non-relational databases might use other systems sych as key-value pairs or a document storage model 

relational databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL
non-relation database: MongoDB and Redis 

much of what the back-end entails is reading, updating, or deleting information stored in a database 
in order to have a consistent way of interacting with data a back-end will often include a web API 
a web API is a collection of predefined ways of, or rules for, interacting with a web applicaiton's data, often through an HTTP request-response cycle 
unlike the http requests a client makes this type of request indicates how it would like to interact with a web application's data--create new data, read existing data, update existing data, or delete existing data--and it recieves some data back as a response

when a user presses the button to submit an order that will trigger a request to send them to a different view of the website--order confirmation page
an additiona request will be triggered from the front-end to the web API so that the database can be updated with the information from the order 

some web apis are open to the public 
others are only used by the web application internally 

authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user 
authorization controls which users have access to which resources and actions 

when building a robust web application back-end we need to incorporate both authentication and authorization into our server-side logic 

most developers make use of frameworks to create a robust back-end 
frameworks are collections of tools that shape the organization of your back-end and provide efficient ways of accomplishing otherwise difficult tasks

laravel framework uses php 
express.js framework uses js 
ruby on rails uses ruby 
spring uses java 
jsf uses java 
flask uses python 
django uses python 
asp.net uses c# 

the stack is the collection fo technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application 

a webserver is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming requests for infromation over the internet and sends back responses 
storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application's back-end 
data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases 
the server-side of a web application is called the application server 
the application server handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication 
the back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an appliation's data through HTTP requests and responses 

arrow expressions has allowed developers to omit parts of the function that they don't need 
when using an arrow expression we do not use the function declaration 
the define an arrow expression you simply use: () => {}
you can pass arguments to an arrow expression between the parenthesis 

a Promise is a js object that represents the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation 
a promise has three different outcomes: pending (the result is undefined and the expression is waiting for a result), 
fulfilled (the promise has been completed successfully and returned a value), and
rejected (the promise did not successfully complete, the result is an error object).

const testLuck = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        resolve('Lucky winner!')
    } else {
        reject(new Error('Unlucky'))
    }
});

testLuck.then(message => {
    console.log(message)
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error)
});

the async...await syntax allows developers to easily implement Promise-based code 

the keyword async used in conjunction with a function declaration creates an async function that returns a Promise 
async function allow us to use the keyword await to block the event loop until a given Promise resolves or rejets 
the await keyword also allows us to assign the resolved value of a Promise to a variable 

const newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("All done!"), 5000);
});

const asyncFunction = async () => {
    const finalResult = await newPromise;
    console.log(finalResult);
}

asyncFunction();

a. create a new promise which passes a function that is executed after 5 seconds 
b. we await the Promise to resolve and save the value returned to finalResult 
c. the output of the Promise is logged to the console 

setInterval() function executes a code block at a specified interval, in milliseconds
- requires two arguments: the name of the function--the code block that will be executed; the number of milliseconds (how often the function will be executed)
the setInterval() function will continue to execute until the clearInterval() function is called or the node process is exited 

const showAlert= () => {
    setInterval( () => {
        alert('I show every 5 seconds!')
    }, 5000);
};

showAlert();

setTimeout() function executes a code block after a specified amount of time (in milliseconds) and is only executed once 
setTimeout() function accepts the same arguments as the setInterval() function 
clearTimeout() function will prevent the funciton specified from being executed 

const showTimeout = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        alert('I only show once after 5 seconds');
    }, 5000);
}

showTimeout();

JSON is a language-independent standard format for storing and exchanging data 
JSON has become the standard for storing and sending data between all programming languages 

json is used to facilitate data transfer in web applications between a client and a server 

When you fill out a web form the form data is converted from html to js object to JSON object and sent to a remote web server for processing 

{ 
    "student": {
        "name": "Rumaisa Mahoney",
        "age": 30,
        "fullTime": true, 
        "langauges": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
        "GPA": 3.9,
        "favoriteSubject": null
    }
}

{ ... } curly braces hold objects 
[ ... ] square brackets hold arrays 
data is stored in name-value pairs separated by a colon, :
every name-value pair is separated from another pair by a comma
trailing commas are forbidden 
JSON property names must be in double-quotes

node.js is a js runtime that allows us to execute js code outside of the browser
a runtime converts code written in a high-level programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute 

node was created with the goal of building web servers and web applications in js 
node can also be used to create command line applications or desktop applications 

node can be combined with any number of robust frameworks like express.js for creating effective web application back-ends 

the node environment contains a number of node-specific global elements in addition to those built into the js language
every node-specific global property sits inside the node global object 

the node global object contains a number of userful properties and methods that are available anywhere in the Node environment

node was designed with server-side web development in mind 

modularity is a software design technique where one program has distinct parts each providing a single piece of the overall functionality
separate modules come together to build a cohesive whole 
modularity is essential for creating scalable programs which incorporates libraries and frameworks and separate the program's concerns into manageable chuncks

a module is a collection of code located in a file 
instead of having an entire program located in a single file code is organized into separate files based on the concerns they address 
modules can then be included in other files by usign the require() function 

core modules are built-in modules to perform common tasks efficiently 
core modules are located in the lib/ folder and are defined within node's source code 
core modules can be required by passing a string with the name of the module into the require() function 

  '_http_agent',       '_http_client',        '_http_common',
  '_http_incoming',    '_http_outgoing',      '_http_server',
  '_stream_duplex',    '_stream_passthrough', '_stream_readable',
  '_stream_transform', '_stream_wrap',        '_stream_writable',
  '_tls_common',       '_tls_wrap',           'assert',
  'async_hooks',       'buffer',              'child_process',
  'cluster',           'console',             'constants',
  'crypto',            'dgram',               'diagnostics_channel',
  'dns',               'domain',              'events',
  'fs',                'fs/promises',         'http',
  'http2',             'https',               'inspector',
  'module',            'net',                 'os',
  'path',              'perf_hooks',          'process',
  'punycode',          'querystring',         'readline',
  'repl',              'stream',              'string_decoder',
  'sys',               'timers',              'tls',
  'trace_events',      'tty',                 'url',
  'util',              'v8',                  'vm',
  'wasi',              'worker_threads',      'zlib'

in node, the terminal is used to send and receive text feedback to and from a program, often for debugging purposes 
in node, the built-in console module exports a global console object that gives the terminal similar functionality 

the console object provides many of the same methods: 
.log() to print messages to the terminal 
.assert() to print a message to the terminal if the value is falsy 
.table() to print out a table in the terminal from an object or array 

a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed 
node has a global process object with useful methods and information about the current process 

process.env property is an object which stores and controls information about the environment in which the process is currently running 

process.argv property holds an array of command line values provided when the current process was initiated 
the first element in the array is the absolute path to Node 
the second element is the path to the file that's running 
following elements will be any command line arguments provided when the process was initiated 

command line arguments are separated from one another with spaces 

the os core module is not global and needs to be included into the file in order to gain access to its methods 
const os = require('os');

os.type() -- returns the computer's operating system 
os.arch() -- return the operating system's CPU architecture 
os.networkInterfaces() -- return information about the network interfaces of the computer such as the IP and MAC addresses 
os.homedir() -- to return the current user's home directory 
os.hostname() -- to return the hostname of the operating system 
os.uptime() -- return the sytem uptime in seconds 

ex: 
const os = require('os');

const local = {
    'Home Directory': os.homedir(),
    'Operating System': os.type(),
    'Last Reboot': os.uptime()
}

utility functions are internal tools used to maintain and debug code 
const util = require('util');

types, which provides methods for runtime type checking in node 
.promisify() turns callback functions into promises 

node is a js runtime that allows us to execute js code by converting it into something a computer can understand 
code can be organized into separate files, modules, and combined through requiring them where needed using the require() function 
console module exports a global console object allowing the terminal to act as a debugging console similar to JS console in web browsers 
process module is a global module that gives access to information about the node runtime environment
os module provides methods to retrieve information about the computer, operating system, and network interfaces 
util module contains methods used to maintain and debug your code
